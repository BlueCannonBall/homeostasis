# homeostasis
A self-regulating process by which biological systems tend to maintain stability while adjusting to conditions that are optimal for survival.

## What is Homeostasis?

Homeostasis is a term used to describe how every organism tends to stay at a dynamic equilibrium to maintain its wellbeing. Sadly, in every organism, it gets harder to maintain homeostasis after a certain age and the organism enters the phase of its death. 

Homeostasis is controllable via feedback loops: positive feedback loops, and negative feedback loops.

In a positive feedback loop, the initial disturbance in homeostasis is amplified over stages. After a certain timeperiod, the disturbance is completely removed. The easiest positive feedback loop to explain is Gestation.

In Gestation the feedback loop goes as follows:
- the baby takes up all possible space in the Uterus
- the Uterus has strech receptors which are triggered
- receptors communicate to the Brain to release Oxytocin
- Oxytocin causes muscle contractions
^^^^ THIS PROCESS KEEPS REPEATING AND AMPLIFYING UNTIL ^^^^
- baby escapes through Vagina

In a negative feedback loop, a disturbance in homeostasis is dealt with by activating a mechanism which will mitigate it. The initial disturbance then stops, and the mechanism is stoppped thereafter.

As an example, an Increase in body temperature would be dealt with as follows:

- the body gets hot
- Hypothalamus signals sweat glands to perspirate. 
- the body releases enough heat
- Hypothalamus signals sweat glands to stop perspiration.

These vital loops are what keep us alive today.
